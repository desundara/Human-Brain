        <p>Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and vast networks of neurons that carry messages throughout the body. It seeks to uncover how this intricate system develops, operates, and affects everything from movement to memory and emotions.</p>
        <p>The brain serves as the command center of the nervous system, coordinating thoughts, emotions, memories, and physical actions. It contains billions of neurons that send and receive information through electrical and chemical signals. Specific brain regions have specialized roles—for example, the frontal lobe is responsible for planning and judgment, while the occipital lobe handles vision. By understanding these functions, scientists can better identify and treat conditions that affect brain health.</p>

        <h1>Neuroplasticity: How the Brain Adapts and Changes</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This capacity allows the brain to adjust in response to learning, sensory input, experiences, and even injury.</p>
        <p>This adaptability is not only essential for learning but also for recovery. After a brain injury, undamaged parts of the brain can often take over the functions of the affected areas by rewiring connections. These changes don't happen instantly, but with time, effort, and the right stimulation, the brain can improve and restore function to surprising degrees.</p>
